The `map` function in JavaScript is used to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of an existing array. It does not modify the original array but returns a new array with the transformed elements.

### Syntax:
```javascript
array.map(callback(element, index, array), thisArg)
```

- **callback**: A function that is called for every element of the array. It receives three arguments:
  - **element**: The current element being processed.
  - **index**: The index of the current element being processed.
  - **array**: The array `map` was called upon.

- **thisArg** (optional): Value to use as `this` when executing the callback.

### Example in Context:
In the `handleAddTodo` function, the `map` function is used to create a new array of todos, where the todo at `currentIndex` is replaced with the new `input` value, while all other todos remain unchanged.

### Detailed Breakdown:
Here's the specific part of the code:
```javascript
const updatedTodos = todos.map((todo, index) => (
  index === currentIndex ? input : todo
));
```

1. **Initial Array**:
   - `todos` is an array of todo items, each represented by a string.

2. **Mapping through the Array**:
   - `todos.map` iterates over each `todo` in the `todos` array.
   - For each `todo`, it checks the `index` of the current element being processed.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - `index === currentIndex ? input : todo`
     - If the current `index` matches `currentIndex`, it means this is the todo item being edited.
     - The ternary operator `? :` is used to decide what value to include in the new array.
     - If the condition `index === currentIndex` is `true`, the new array will include `input` at this position, effectively updating the todo.
     - If the condition is `false`, it includes the original `todo`.

### Example:
Assume `todos` is `['Buy milk', 'Walk the dog', 'Do homework']` and `currentIndex` is `1`, and `input` is `'Walk the cat'`.

**Original Array:**
```javascript
todos = ['Buy milk', 'Walk the dog', 'Do homework'];
```

**Using `map`:**
```javascript
const updatedTodos = todos.map((todo, index) => (
  index === currentIndex ? input : todo
));
```

**Iteration Steps:**

- **First Iteration (`index = 0`)**:
  - `todo` is `'Buy milk'`.
  - `index === currentIndex` evaluates to `0 === 1`, which is `false`.
  - The result is `'Buy milk'`.

- **Second Iteration (`index = 1`)**:
  - `todo` is `'Walk the dog'`.
  - `index === currentIndex` evaluates to `1 === 1`, which is `true`.
  - The result is `input`, which is `'Walk the cat'`.

- **Third Iteration (`index = 2`)**:
  - `todo` is `'Do homework'`.
  - `index === currentIndex` evaluates to `2 === 1`, which is `false`.
  - The result is `'Do homework'`.

**Resulting Array:**
```javascript
updatedTodos = ['Buy milk', 'Walk the cat', 'Do homework'];
```

This `map` function effectively creates a new array where the todo at the specified index is updated, while all other todos remain unchanged.
